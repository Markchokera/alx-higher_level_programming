## Objectives
This project is full of quiz and it is a little bit different than the usual projects. The first part is only answers to questions about Python’s specificity like “What would be the result of…”

- What is an object
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment

- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- What are the built-in mutable types
- What are the built-in immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions
